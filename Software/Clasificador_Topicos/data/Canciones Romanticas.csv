Regrets and mistakes they're memories made
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
And catch the tears whenever you cry
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I'm out of my head hopelessly devoted to you
And now you know I can´t smile without you
I go out every night and sleep all day
Just to let you know that I'm still around
Well life would still go on believe me
Oh then turn around and make up
You're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide
If she said that's the way it ought to be
Though life would still go on believe me
Now my baby's dancin' but she's dancin' with another man
"And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over"
I'll think of you each step of the way
Somewhere in her smile she knows
It's been so lonely without you here
You're my end and my beginning
Is there really no chance to start once again?
They say true love's the greatest weapon
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I found a dream that I could speak to
God only knows what I'd be without you
Trying to hold on to your high-class love
You stick around now it may show
Before I say another word let me tell you i love you
You've got my head spinning no kidding I can't pin you down
My heart was wrapped up in clover
Wise men say only fools rush in
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
And I hope life will treat you kind
Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you?
What can make me feel this way?
He can never want some other girl
If you leave me now you´ll take away the biggest part of me
I'll be the moon when the sun goes down
Love your curves and all your edges
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
True love breathes salvation back into me
And tell you time and time again how much I care
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim
It started out as a feeling which then grew into a hope
That you found a girl and you're married now
I'll be the weeping willow drowning in my tears
And I'll be the rainbow after the tears are gone
But I'm willing to give it another try
