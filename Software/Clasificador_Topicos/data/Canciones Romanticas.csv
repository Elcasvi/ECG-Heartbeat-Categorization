God only knows what I'd be without you
Trying to hold on to your high-class love
You stick around now it may show
Before I say another word let me tell you i love you
You've got my head spinning no kidding I can't pin you down
My heart was wrapped up in clover
Wise men say only fools rush in
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
And I hope life will treat you kind
Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you?
What can make me feel this way?
He can never want some other girl
If you leave me now youÂ´ll take away the biggest part of me
I'll be the moon when the sun goes down
Love your curves and all your edges
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
True love breathes salvation back into me
And tell you time and time again how much I care
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim
It started out as a feeling which then grew into a hope
That you found a girl and you're married now
I'll be the weeping willow drowning in my tears
And I'll be the rainbow after the tears are gone
But I'm willing to give it another try
