Regrets and mistakes they're memories made,1
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl,1
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees,1
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again,1
And catch the tears whenever you cry,1
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times,1
I'm out of my head hopelessly devoted to you,1
And now you know I can't smile without you,1
I go out every night and sleep all day,1
Just to let you know that I'm still around,1
Well life would still go on believe me,1
Oh then turn around and make up,1
You're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide,1
If she said that's the way it ought to be,1
Though life would still go on believe me,1
Now my baby's dancin' but she's dancin' with another man,1
"And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over",1
I'll think of you each step of the way,1
Somewhere in her smile she knows,1
It's been so lonely without you here,1
You're my end and my beginning,1
Is there really no chance to start once again?,1
They say true love's the greatest weapon,1
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May,1
I found a dream that I could speak to,1
